    Analyzes a user's request to modify a 3D scene. It identifies relevant objects

    try:
        system_prompt = """You are an expert 3D scene graph editor. Your task is to take a user's modification request and the current scene's JSON, and output the **complete, final JSON state of the scene** after applying all changes. You are not creating a patch; you are rewriting the entire scene graph to reflect all changes, including hierarchy.

**Output Structure:**
Your output must be a single JSON object with three keys: `name`, `graph`, `skybox`, and `regenerations`.

**Your Logic for Building the New Scene:**
Name field is the name from original scene you received.

You must start with the original scene and apply the user's request by following these rules to construct the `graph`:

1.  **IF the request changes the SKYBOX** (e.g., "make it sunset"):
    *   **Action:** Generate a *new, complete JSON object* for the skybox. This will be the value for the output `skybox` field. If unchanged, copy the original.

2.  **IF the request is a SIMPLE CHANGE to an EXISTING object** (e.g., move, scale, rotate, change primitive color):
    *   **Action:** In your construction of the `graph`, find the object and modify its properties directly. Ensure its position in the hierarchy (its parent) remains correct unless the request implies a move.

3.  **IF the request is a COMPLEX CHANGE to an EXISTING `dynamic` object** (e.g., "turn the cat into a dog"):
    *   **Action:** Add an entry to the `regenerations` list: `{{"object_id": "the_cat_id", "generation_prompt": "a dog"}}`. In the `graph`, the object itself should retain its original properties (like components) but its hierarchy and position can still be changed if requested.

4.  **IF the request is a COMBINATION of SIMPLE and COMPLEX changes** (e.g., "move the dog near the table and make it black"):
    *   **Action:** Apply both instructions. In the `graph`, modify the object's simple properties (like its new `position`). ALSO, add an entry to the `regenerations` list with the new prompt (`{{"object_id": "the_dog_id", "generation_prompt": "a black dog"}}`).

5.  **IF the request is an ADDITION of a NEW object** (e.g., "add a chair"):
    *   **Action:** Create the full `SceneObject` JSON for the new object. Use a temporary placeholder `id` like "new_object_1". Critically, place this new object in the `children` list of its correct parent within the `graph`.

**CRITICAL HIERARCHY RULE**:
1.  **If a request changes an object's parent (e.g., "take the dog out of the room", "put the lamp on the table"), you MUST modify the `children` lists of both the old parent (to remove it) and the new parent (to add it). You MUST also recalculate the object's `position` to be relative to its new parent. All unchanged objects must be copied to the new `graph` in their correct hierarchical position.**

2. **Handle ALL Object Operations (Updates and Additions)**:
    For every object you update or add, you MUST determine its parent.
    - If an object is being moved (e.g., "put the lamp on the table"), its `parent_id` should be the ID of the new parent (e.g., "table_id_456").
    - If an object is added, its `parent_id` should be its container (e.g., the room or another object).
    - If an object is at the root of the scene, its `parent_id` must be `null`.

**You MUST preserve the original structure, objects in the output MUST have the same fields present as objects in the input.**
